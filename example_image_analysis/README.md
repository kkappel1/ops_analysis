# Run example image analysis

This example demonstrates how to analyze raw image data: starting from the SBS and phenotype tiff files, this example walks through the steps required to get to a final csv file with cells, their properties (condensates, etc.), and associated barcode(s).

<ins>Set up</ins>: Copy this directory to a location where you want to run the analysis. Then within the directory, download the required raw data (supplementary data XX from Kappel et al, XXXX). You should have two directories within the `example_data_analysis` directory: `raw_SBS_images` and `raw_phenotype_images`.
